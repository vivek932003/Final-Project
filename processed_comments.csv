"*WATCH PART 2 AFTER!* It includes an efficiency discussion: https://youtu.be/oJL9MasBFvM

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* Obviously, I should have discussed efficiency, as I have in almost every video where I discuss EVs. EVs are often 3-4x as energy efficient, meaning you need *less* energy total to move a certain distance (compared to the very best diesels, they're about 2x as efficient). That's why a ""3 gallon"" tank Tesla can drive 350 miles. Again, as mentioned in the video, the sweet spot right now is EV passenger cars. When you talk about towing, freight trucks, trains, planes, etc, the weight gain is not offset by the efficiency gain. Don't believe me? Here's the math: https://youtu.be/S4W-P5aCWJs
*UPDATE TWO:* I hope no one interprets this video as electric cars aren't cleaner/more efficient/better for the environment. They most certainly are: https://youtu.be/6RhtiPefVzM. Also an important consideration if you're in the market for an EV is buying the range that you need. A smaller battery has a significantly lower impact than larger batteries, and will offset its carbon footprint much faster. Obviously, this will result in lower range (city commuting, multi-car family, etc).",watch part 2 includes efficiency discussion important note obviously discussed efficiency almost every video discuss evs evs often 3 4x energy efficient meaning need less energy total move certain distance compared best diesels 2x efficient 3 gallon tank tesla drive 350 miles mentioned video sweet spot right ev passenger cars talk towing freight trucks trains planes etc weight gain offset efficiency gain believe math update two hope one interprets video electric cars cleaner efficient better environment certainly also important consideration market ev buying range need smaller battery significantly lower impact larger batteries offset carbon footprint much faster obviously result lower range city commuting multi car family etc

"What is going to kill the ev industry is the insurance companies. How? Sometime into the future an ev buyer from the dealer showroom will call their insurance company agent and with excitement tell their agent that they are buying an ev and they currently pay day 1000 a month. Buying that ev is going to cost 4 or 5000 dollars a month because when an ev starts on fire in a garage it burns the house down and the neighbors house and kills someone.  So when an ev starts on fire and 20 other cars also go up in flames and when you can’t park your 100k dollar car in your own garage or any garage or any covered parking lot, you in essence make the ev very unaffordable to especially the person who can barely afford the car in the first place. Insurance companies are already prohibiting ev owners from charging their ev’s indoors and some don’t want you to even park ev’s indoors. At the end of the day, insurance companies will make ev’s unaffordable to operate. If you can’t afford the insurance, you can’t drive or operate one.",going kill ev industry insurance companies sometime future ev buyer dealer showroom call insurance company agent excitement tell agent buying ev currently pay day 1000 month buying ev going cost 4 5000 dollars month ev starts fire garage burns house neighbors house kills someone ev starts fire 20 cars also go flames park 100k dollar car garage garage covered parking lot essence make ev unaffordable especially person barely afford car first place insurance companies already prohibiting ev owners charging ev indoors want even park ev indoors end day insurance companies make ev unaffordable operate afford insurance drive operate one

"Lots of flaws in your arguments. Yes, EVs are heavier because battery packs are bigger and heavier. But other than that, there are very few components in an EV versus a ICE car, thus making it substantially easier to maintain. Second, yes they cost more upfront but they turn our to be cheaper during the entire lifetime of the vehicle due to much lower maintenance & fuel costs. Third, you calculation for Mazda is flawed. EVs are projected to gain much more market share in the next 10-15 years. Many European cities even have targets to ban ICE cars after 2040. So, the net environmental impact shall be much higher if they switch to EVs.",lots flaws arguments yes evs heavier battery packs bigger heavier components ev versus ice car thus making substantially easier maintain second yes cost upfront turn cheaper entire lifetime vehicle due much lower maintenance fuel costs third calculation mazda flawed evs projected gain much market share next 10 15 years many european cities even targets ban ice cars 2040 net environmental impact shall much higher switch evs

"Early adopter of the very best in E-Bikes. I bought a BionX brand, produced by Magna Industries and chosen by Mercedes Benz as the motor/battery/controller for their electric Smart Bike, sold in dealerships alongside the Smart micro cars. Ten years later they're out-of-business and my efforts to be environmentally responsible have resulted in very expensive LAND FILL.
 Same with the German made, Torqeedo electric outboard motor I bought, at more than TWICE the price of an ICE motor. Now that I need a new battery for it, the company tells me they ""no longer support"" my purchase. No parts or batteries available. More high priced land fill.

"You forgot to take into account engine efficiency vs motor efficiency (thermodynamic efficiency) when comparing the amount of ""fuel"" by volume used (leaving out the amount WASTED). All modern gas powered 4 stroke engines have 20-40% (avg small cars are typically 25-30% if they are in perfect condition and relatively new and maintained well. NOT including idle which drops this as well) efficiency due to only having one power stroke, more if you have turbo and a few more % if you have diesel. EV a/c motors have 85-98%+ efficiency(based on the DOE and several tech organizations and non-profit organizations which study modern manufacturing plants and data).

30Kwh vs gas... Why are you comparing a leaf to gas instead of modern EV'S that have 90kWh packs or larger (3x what you compare to... ). We also have batteries that are non toxic, cheaper to make and much safer and higher power density and much faster charging potential currently being developed in multiple countries around the world as I write this (borene, Graphene, Sodium etc) . 

People will blame Ev problems on ""no universal power/charging infrastructure"" ... But you could say that exact same thing about gas cars when they started! Gasoline was hard to get, while horse and carriages were cheap and required no gas... Good luck finding  a mechanic back then too! 

Ev's are lower profit margin and higher cost due to low volume manufacturing and high start up costs... Combustion is a rip off. But both elevate prices to make profit and honestly the current monopolies don't help either industry. At this point the li-ion battery is cheap and their prices are overpriced, it's where the price comes in since motors are easy to source and not too expensive compared to combustion engines. 

Your argument about the environment doesn't make sense... As it's all based on nothing but greed on the manufacturers side and people spreading misinformation which keeps the Ev sales market low, mostly Republicans who are biased against new tech and progression or evolution.

I used to see your videos were neutral but somewhere along the lines you started pushing your biased opinions and changing the rhetoric of all these ""facts"" to agree with you. I am a self taught engineer, researcher, and evaluate, repair, and build lithium batteries and have 20+yrs of automotive mechanic, electrical and race engine tuning, emissions tuning (and surpassing) and engine design on my belt. However, I can't say I agree with most of the points made in this video. I know you like cars because you dropped your other topics for cars but...

"Something that I continually see as an example, but no one delves too deep into, is that so many EV owners admit they they have to have a second ICE car for road trips, etc. What I never see factored into the cost of owning an EV is the additional cost of the ICE car for back up. Some people will argure ""well....   I use the EV for around town and save the cost of the gas"". If I still have to have an ICE vehicle, and the only reason I have the EV is to save on gas for around town, I can argue that I can buy a LOT of gas for the cost of the EV. So, if a person still has to own an ICE because the EV won't do what THEY need to do then it's hardly cost effective to own both.",something continually see example one delves deep many ev owners admit second ice car road trips etc never see factored cost owning ev additional cost ice car back people argure well use ev around town save cost gas still ice vehicle reason ev save gas around town argue buy lot gas cost ev person still ice ev need hardly cost effective

"You don't get it, don't you?
It does not matter if we can replace the performance of gas, because we should had stopped using it yesterday🙄
The entire video follows the wrong premise, spreads the wrong idea and is responsible for trillions of dollar in damage due to freak weather. Shame on you!",get matter replace performance gas stopped using yesterday entire video follows wrong premise spreads wrong idea responsible trillions dollar damage due freak weather shame

"Mainly why the diesel engine will never go away. Impossible. For a single EV to exist. It takes thousands of diesel-powered equipment to make one single battery. To make every part of a EV. Again. We have thousands of diesel-powered equipment to get all the supplies from the ground, to the factory, to the dealership. Where I say earth doesn't have a IQ. It's called reverse engineering. Like EVs or not. If it wasn't for the common engine. An EV would never exist. Yet. It's entertaining to read the comments, etc. On what people think. Like. No more gas and diesel engines. Yes!!!! Well. That means no EVs at all. The battery materials come from Africa. Then. Has to go to China. Then. Wherever. Go take your EV and go do it then. I watch. Maybe. Yet. Thanks for the entertainment and proving Earth has no IQ.",mainly diesel engine never go away impossible single ev exist takes thousands diesel powered equipment make one single battery make every part ev thousands diesel powered equipment get supplies ground factory dealership say earth iq called reverse engineering like evs common engine ev would never exist yet entertaining read comments etc people think like gas diesel engines yes well means evs battery materials come africa go china wherever go take ev go watch maybe yet thanks entertainment proving earth iq

"All the reasons stated here are the reason why US and EU car makers will be beaten by the Chinese.  China is going all-in on electric cars.  This video all made sense in 2018, and it’s what the US car manufacturers did. Now they are all failing in China, which is the largest car market in the world. China is starting to import electric cars to the West that are cheaper and better than their western competitors.  There is a paradigm shift that the western car manufacturers weren’t ready for, and still aren’t ready for.  It’s too late for them to catch up now.  Sorry but it’s true.",reasons stated reason us eu car makers beaten chinese china going electric cars video made sense 2018 us car manufacturers failing china largest car market world china starting import electric cars west cheaper better western competitors paradigm shift western car manufacturers ready still ready late catch sorry true
"Lfp batteries are even less energy dense, we've come a long way in 4 years... Lol",lfp batteries even less energy dense come long way 4 years lol
You use only 1/3 of the energy content on gasoline... the rest is heat to the atmosphere,use 1 3 energy content gasoline rest heat atmosphere
