"Ya this is an good invention that we drive ev cars through non-chargable and no time wasting as well.but,how we park the cars in in our home so,we need these electrical lanes in our home i don't know that it will recharge while driving through the road on the electric lanes.if we said it as a fool just sorry for that.but,in the future,one thing that sure that people can't not walk the road because there are electricals these lanes if some one walk there he should being shocked and die..... Technology is flying they will find solutions.....just hope and AWARE ....üòÇ",667e8d19fa9123ecadb71631917bbbc2,2023-12-06T09:54:19Z,0,0

"Its a great technology. There are many concerns.... many people have already listed it. 
The smaller problems.
1. Drive a straight line. Can be solve with a wider contactor(from the car) to compensate for the left and right swaying of the vehicle. 

Now the good thing. 
1. Good for traffic jams, where certain distance the vehicles (EV only and not IC engines) can charge their vehicle while going at a slow turtle pace or at a complete stop due to traffic congestion. 
a) it helps reduce the losses from such congestion. 
b) Only at moderate to massive congestion location. Not the entire road system.",9fe9f95afa1f02c8987cf58899e229dd,2023-09-13T13:11:47Z,0,0

"hello dear friends.  I am Russian, I am not a native speaker, please forgive me for possible errors in the text.  My very close friend, a Ukrainian, was held hostage in Somalia because he is gay, he was constantly subjected to sexual violence and other bullying.  me and my friends friends managed to raise money and find an opportunity to redeem it.  But those people who helped me had difficulties, they were able to buy it out, but my friend ended up in Cambodia and got stuck there.  Now he is in a very bad condition, he has cancer, doctors in Cambodia cannot help him.  I found a Rambam clinic in Israel who agreed to help.  But the fact is that I sold an apartment in Russia in order to ransom my Ukrainian friend from the hostages in Somalia.  now I have no money to help him, moreover, I have no opportunity even to go to him.  One good friend helped me open crypto wallets, because.  I don‚Äôt understand anything about this, and advised me to ask for help on the Internet.  Dear friends, brothers and sisters, no matter how hard it is for me to seek help in this way, but I am in despair and have to turn to you for help, everyone who has the opportunity to help, I beg you Help.  as much as you can, at least a cent even a dollar, any financial support can save a person who has learned a lot of suffering in his 30 years.

"From a purely engineering point this is an absurd plan, the term efficiency relates to how much energy would be wasted so say a direct charge has an 83% efficiency and could be up to 90% a system like this would only amount to a 50% efficiency at best but most likely being closer to 40% meaning we would have to produce roughly twice the amount of energy to charge the vehicles. 

Factor in the insanely high carbon emissions production of EV have in the first place this system would cause higher global emissions than your combustion engine automobile.",1d89d3f4f28da91d3dfc7e0fe3d2764b,2023-08-02T11:39:54Z,0,0
"As a mechanical and aerospace engineer I find it preposterous we are switching to electric cars in the first place. Electric cars currently at least are of lower quality and longevity compared to your average combustion vehicle plus the carbon footprint due to the higher production output would only be marginally less than a combustion car.

The future should be an initial push to hybrid cars while we try to innovate in the electric storage (battery) technology and electric grid. If the electric grid like in today is largely depended on gas it makes little sense to switch to electric as we are still contributing to global warming.

The automotive industry as a whole is responsible for roughly 28% of emissions worldwide while electricity production is responsible for a further 25%. What we need in order to tackle global warming is a concentrated effort towards efficiency around all sectors rather than trying to set up a whole new system. 

Increasing the share of renewable technologies, investing in lab grown meat products, making the car industry more efficient by better hybrid technology, lowering industry (23% of total emissions) carbon footprint and improving residential energy efficiency such as phasing out pollutant gas heating would represent a 50% drop in emissions by 2030 rather than gutting the cad industry in a empty effort to show voters government is doing something about climate change.",1d89d3f4f28da91d3dfc7e0fe3d2764b,2023-08-02T11:33:15Z,0,0

"That is going to be a monumental nightmare in terms of road maintenance and cost. I don't think most people understand just how rapidly roads degrade and deform. Delicate systems that like that built into a road that is constantly deforming over time is going to make maintance / repair costs far too cost prohibitive I suspect. A single car crash on that strip will likely cause catastrophic damage to it and require very expensive repairs. While this seems like a novel idea, practically speaking I just don't see it ever becoming a viable reality beyond a few test roads. Also this is far too vague on actual power output - I am highly skeptical about the amount of meaningful power it can provide to charge a car.",3d4f2a8395e31d2d6287849dc9932bed,2023-07-08T18:56:00Z,165,22

"This is absolutely brilliant! A game changer! A paradigm shift! Imagine if larger vehicles could be similarly adapted, carrying say 30 passengers around town. Or a number of carriages linked together to transport goods up and down the country. Perhaps in time, we can move away from embedding the electrified rails in the road and contact can be made overhead or off-centre somehow. May bring down infrastructure costs and maintenance too. In time, the success of these could obviate the need for personal vehicles.
