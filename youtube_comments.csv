"*WATCH PART 2 AFTER!* It includes an efficiency discussion: https://youtu.be/oJL9MasBFvM

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* Obviously, I should have discussed efficiency, as I have in almost every video where I discuss EVs. EVs are often 3-4x as energy efficient, meaning you need *less* energy total to move a certain distance (compared to the very best diesels, they're about 2x as efficient). That's why a ""3 gallon"" tank Tesla can drive 350 miles. Again, as mentioned in the video, the sweet spot right now is EV passenger cars. When you talk about towing, freight trucks, trains, planes, etc, the weight gain is not offset by the efficiency gain. Don't believe me? Here's the math: https://youtu.be/S4W-P5aCWJs
*UPDATE TWO:* I hope no one interprets this video as electric cars aren't cleaner/more efficient/better for the environment. They most certainly are: https://youtu.be/6RhtiPefVzM. Also an important consideration if you're in the market for an EV is buying the range that you need. A smaller battery has a significantly lower impact than larger batteries, and will offset its carbon footprint much faster. Obviously, this will result in lower range (city commuting, multi-car family, etc)."
Obsolete video alert
"Thanks for the video, have you got a 2024 figures and battery stats ?"
"What is going to kill the ev industry is the insurance companies. How? Sometime into the future an ev buyer from the dealer showroom will call their insurance company agent and with excitement tell their agent that they are buying an ev and they currently pay day 1000 a month. Buying that ev is going to cost 4 or 5000 dollars a month because when an ev starts on fire in a garage it burns the house down and the neighbors house and kills someone.  So when an ev starts on fire and 20 other cars also go up in flames and when you can’t park your 100k dollar car in your own garage or any garage or any covered parking lot, you in essence make the ev very unaffordable to especially the person who can barely afford the car in the first place. Insurance companies are already prohibiting ev owners from charging their ev’s indoors and some don’t want you to even park ev’s indoors. At the end of the day, insurance companies will make ev’s unaffordable to operate. If you can’t afford the insurance, you can’t drive or operate one."
7:00 you didn’t metioned that even when the energy density in gasoline car is bigger combustion engine still only uses 25% of the energy to spin the wheels and electric motors uses more than 99%!
Also the EV`s is a solution to a problem (real pollution not Co2) that only exist in larger cities...
"ICE is dead, it just didn't get the memo yet. When the good batteries solutions will exit the drawers and get produced it is game over for ICE."
Would be great to see you remake this video based on the tech today
"You are very smart! I love your channel, very informative and thank you. What is your name EE? I'am Steve from the Great White North (London Ontario Canada) Super cool content!"
I am watching this in 2024 and can say that this aged well.
EVs suck
"i dont think people are lazy 
its more like they want whats easy even more then they want whats good"
"What we really need to figure out is some kinda dystopian form of energy to drive on, like a teeny tiny nuclear generator that lets us drive forever"
"Thanks for making my point about battery cars being Useless, you did forget these things are a Mega Fire hazard too, I wonder if anyone has house insurance for battery fires. Also you forgot to mention batteries are very temperature dependent & can't handle the heat waves or the cold. And no I drive a 29 year old Cruiser because it's so easily serviceable & it never gives me any problems, just like a tradesman never sells his tools I won't get rid of my reliable beast."
This FUD hasn't aged well after four years. One of the big problems we seem to  have is you and your channel Engineering Misexplained.
"By the time oil runs out, bioethanol will take the place while electric battery is still not mature enough"
"I’m pretty sure ICE cars will exist for another 1-2 decades. But can you do a version of this video? Maybe every few years and see hot many of your arguments holds? Today, some EV market shares has changed and the cost of production has also changed. Interested to see your thoughts every so often"
Pffffrrrrrt
Have you done a math/video on total energy efficiency. From mining materials to end consumer. Combustion vs electric?
Well visualized
"Lots of flaws in your arguments. Yes, EVs are heavier because battery packs are bigger and heavier. But other than that, there are very few components in an EV versus a ICE car, thus making it substantially easier to maintain. Second, yes they cost more upfront but they turn our to be cheaper during the entire lifetime of the vehicle due to much lower maintenance & fuel costs. Third, you calculation for Mazda is flawed. EVs are projected to gain much more market share in the next 10-15 years. Many European cities even have targets to ban ICE cars after 2040. So, the net environmental impact shall be much higher if they switch to EVs."
"The space argument doesn’t fly. A Tesla Y has way more space than a much larger car like the Volvo V90. EVs a normally mor spacious than corresponding ICE car. Weight is also starting to not be an issue. A BMW M3 now weighs more than a Tesla M3 performance. And yore not seeing them take off…. that’s in USA. In china 40% new cars are EVs and they make more cars than US.
In Norway 90% are EV"
The day I don’t need an internal combustion car is the day I die
"well now four years later: batteries are much better, the price of an EV is dropping quickly, and now about 7% of cars being sold are electric. ICE's might be around for another two decades, but electric cars will take the lead in the not too far future"
They need combustion engines to mine and ship all the materials to make the e.v
"hydrogen is the future fuel, or ammonia water... etc."
"Batteries will hit a ceiling of density.  I don't know how close they can get to hydrocarbon energy density but there will be a limit after which one just will not be able to stuff anymore energy into a space.  
On the other hand one has to also remember that ICE's also waste a lot of that gasoline as heat without ever getting work out of it.  Electric make up for a lot of that lack of density because of this."
You're forgetting one thing the freedom that the government gives us we don't live in a free country we live in a country that freedom is determined by what the government does and if the government chooses to get rid of all combustion engines they will vanish we will not be allowed to drive them and they will push their agenda of electricity upon us and there will be nothing we can do just look at what government has done to the combustion engine in the past since 1973 you just don't realize the power that the government has in controlling the people as to what freedoms they're allowed to have and you think that's a stretch you just watch them if they want it they'll get it and if it costs you more you'll pay it cuz you won't have a choice they'll take your combustion engine car away from you and you can probably say no that'll never happen well you can probably think of a lot of examples that you thought the government would never do and they did it look at all the crap they put on the cars to make them green and the next step will be make only green cars auto manufacturers and it's up to you to figure it out this new green deal is this another way of controlling the masses of the people and believe what you want but you're not free you have freedom that the government allows you to have.😂
"Real quick, but in your first 2 mins of the video, you mentioned your gallon of gas has 33.7kw of energy saying that that gallon has more energy then the 1st gen leaf battery. But did you compensate for the fact that most of that gas is wasted though heat and power loss snd not used for propulsion?"
Did you really show a picture of the world economic forum ?? Agenda 2030 in full swing..... pure Evil
An electric plane wouldn't need to carry passengers.
I think there's some results of lead poisoning here!   Haven't researched the specks yet but I think one lithium battery can destroy by fire more than about 4 fuel tankers of gasoline. Also remember that manufacturing  one lithium battery creates many times the pollution  fossil fuels!
"I'd like to point out that hybrid cars' MPG ranges from the best that you can get from older, lighter cars and ultra light cars (civics, miatas, etc,) at about 50mpg and 75 mpg, which is what some  mptorcycles run at (the most feul efficient bikes are easily in the 100-120mpg range)"
"So this is why theres no 93 camry sized electric cars?
Long live the giant hatchbacks lol 
🤧 we need the 5 foot long cars again"
"One caveat- You're somewhat misrepresenting the comparative mass and volume of these fuels.  
ICE engines only use 30% of the energy in that gallon of gasoline.  Electric motors use over 75% of the energy in a battery.  So you need to compare 2.5 gallons, not 1."
The batteries are much heavier than the Gallon of fuel
"as each year passes, love to revisit this video to see how much ev tech and batteries have improved past the u.s."
Would there be an advantage in putting an oxygen concentrator in front of a combustion engine?
"This entire situation is a real tragedy.  Gasoline is orders of magnitude better as a transportation energy source.  Almost unbeatable in terms of the numbers.  Of course we have to do something about the environment, but the race to implement hideously less efficient tech, that has awful environmental impacts to produce, and without the infrastructure to support it, is just a monumental waste of resources.  And instead of committing to it, and making it a singular priority, we're going to go back and forth between the two, based the whims of the market."
"8:02 as a 98' Civic owner, that hurts"
Hello????? Pls don’t delete this video 10 years from today.
Cuz ICE cars are cheaper and every gas stations are everywhere..
"Early adopter of the very best in E-Bikes. I bought a BionX brand, produced by Magna Industries and chosen by Mercedes Benz as the motor/battery/controller for their electric Smart Bike, sold in dealerships alongside the Smart micro cars. Ten years later they're out-of-business and my efforts to be environmentally responsible have resulted in very expensive LAND FILL.
 Same with the German made, Torqeedo electric outboard motor I bought, at more than TWICE the price of an ICE motor. Now that I need a new battery for it, the company tells me they ""no longer support"" my purchase. No parts or batteries available. More high priced land fill.
 Instead of buying an ICE, which would still be serviceable today, I am now faced with purchasing another outboard motor and a new motorcycle, and I assure you, NEITHER will be electric.
Electric Car? Not a FN chance."
"You forgot to take into account engine efficiency vs motor efficiency (thermodynamic efficiency) when comparing the amount of ""fuel"" by volume used (leaving out the amount WASTED). All modern gas powered 4 stroke engines have 20-40% (avg small cars are typically 25-30% if they are in perfect condition and relatively new and maintained well. NOT including idle which drops this as well) efficiency due to only having one power stroke, more if you have turbo and a few more % if you have diesel. EV a/c motors have 85-98%+ efficiency(based on the DOE and several tech organizations and non-profit organizations which study modern manufacturing plants and data).

30Kwh vs gas... Why are you comparing a leaf to gas instead of modern EV'S that have 90kWh packs or larger (3x what you compare to... ). We also have batteries that are non toxic, cheaper to make and much safer and higher power density and much faster charging potential currently being developed in multiple countries around the world as I write this (borene, Graphene, Sodium etc) . 

People will blame Ev problems on ""no universal power/charging infrastructure"" ... But you could say that exact same thing about gas cars when they started! Gasoline was hard to get, while horse and carriages were cheap and required no gas... Good luck finding  a mechanic back then too! 

Ev's are lower profit margin and higher cost due to low volume manufacturing and high start up costs... Combustion is a rip off. But both elevate prices to make profit and honestly the current monopolies don't help either industry. At this point the li-ion battery is cheap and their prices are overpriced, it's where the price comes in since motors are easy to source and not too expensive compared to combustion engines. 

Your argument about the environment doesn't make sense... As it's all based on nothing but greed on the manufacturers side and people spreading misinformation which keeps the Ev sales market low, mostly Republicans who are biased against new tech and progression or evolution.

I used to see your videos were neutral but somewhere along the lines you started pushing your biased opinions and changing the rhetoric of all these ""facts"" to agree with you. I am a self taught engineer, researcher, and evaluate, repair, and build lithium batteries and have 20+yrs of automotive mechanic, electrical and race engine tuning, emissions tuning (and surpassing) and engine design on my belt. However, I can't say I agree with most of the points made in this video. I know you like cars because you dropped your other topics for cars but... Most mechanics know engineers  know theory but fail in practice. I've done both and verified this.

I'd advise you having a well versed tech as council for this topic looking forward."
Love me some LaCrotch Water
"And it is much faster to fill a Fuel Tank, then to charge a Batterie."
Electric drivetrain is so much better. Have a BEV with an onboard small IC generator.
“Tesla battery pack ≈ to 3 gallons of gas” 😤😂 working in a car dealership’s parts department I can tell you I’d much rather store crate engines all day than battery packs 😬
parking ramps have to be improved else they will collapse with the additional weight of fully populated ramps with EVs
mechanics do not know how to repair EVs thus repair costs are high...as are insurance costs since EVs more likely get totaled since they are expensive to fix.
biden has epa mandates that ICEs cannot reach.  we will be switching to EVs whether we want to or not.
you express a lot of confidence that battery technology will continue to improve.  Any evidence for that?  And improve by how much?  10%?  Just a reminder that Thomas Edison used lead acid batteries in his lab.  Guess what is still in cars today over 100 years later?  Same thing.  Not much improvement.
"Energy density of gasoline for a combustion engine is only 1/3 of potential energy density we are able to get somehow from the gasoline. The 2/3 of the energy goes for heating the atmosphere, which has no practical usage. Therefore comparing the energy densities does not make much sense."
EV's= lithium ion fire bomb.
"The whole weight subject is a wash. While the power source is heavier, the drive train is lighter. So while gasoline is lighter, the whole motor is heavier."
The engine from Ev are a smaller
"Petrol Ped does a video on having a charger at home and asks a grid operator what would happen if everyone in his neighborhood had one or two at home wouldn't that be great? He said no grid couldn't handle it. Science. It's not lazy as to why more people don't own EV's. It's science. And engineering. Something you should probably know about. Do a white board video on everyone in your neighborhood, town, or city, switching to having one to two fast chargers charging 1 to 2 cars overnight every night for a month."
Electric cars. Solution to a problem that doesn't exist.
You  must live in a warm climate. After 4 years they should have been further along in development than they are. and new reports say EVs pollute more.
"If you are rich, you don't care about the cost. If you are pore, you drive a 2000 crown vic.230000 miles so far. How many batteries would you have to dispose of at that milage. 2? What if you fast charge always? 3? How much of the power at night comes from natural gas and coal?"
"The current EV's for sale are not mature products (yet)
They are unmatured products, sometimes brought quickly in the market in order to avoid government fines, or to respond to government tax incentives for customers etc...
Examples
The new Lotus Eletre SUV  with a price tag of  more than 100.000 Euro will get - according to Lotus- it's battery heater from April 2024, in order to remedy it's sloppy performance at cold temperatures.
There are electric VW Transporter customers, reporting they are unable to defrost their car on a winter morning, WITH THE VEHICLE STILL PLUGGED INTO THE CHARGER.
etc.., etc...etc...."
A year or 4 can change everything - now the USGS has identified 200 trillion tons of hydrogen deposited just in the USA; other nations are also finding naturally occuring hydrogen deposits.  if this can be economically extracted; we will have a thousand years worth of hydrogen at low cost.
"iPhone 8 pro is a great phone,  no one will mention it everyday conversation, but I like the home button ,  refined to perfection. Combustion engines will have their iPhone X pro moment.. And people will be tribal about the beast in the trunk and will want raw about it.  People might even start dumping the EVs into the ocean, like that bill Meyers gay joke about roller skates.. .. I enjoy your content,  just thought I’d comment, for the sake of saying something and thanks for you great work."
"synthetic fuels are coming .. Zero emissions ,,,,,,, and work in any ICE motor .. China is leading the EV market ,,,, with their spy devices ,, NO WAY they will allow it mm China is our biggest threat mm ,, constant charges with subscription's to operate an EV funding the CCCP and Space X .. EV's are constant subscriptions ,, a cash cow ,, They can send a signal shut your car down and service it for 10k hmmm!!!   what if Elon goes under how will you update or fix your 80k car mm hmmm  ,, Nascar is already using synthetic fuels ,, EV's lose all their value you cannot even trade them in or sell them used ,,,  if the battery fails under warranty they give you a remanufactured  battery pieced together from other older cells ,,,WTF ICE car you get a new motor not a used one hahahh aggagaga"
"Only 30% of gasoline energy is used to move the car, the other 70% is wasted into heat. I have a Model Y, for same distance traveled, it cost 30% in electricity as gasoline. Which tells you  electric car is more efficient, even with a heavy battery."
"I am intrigued what that sodas taste like. They are not available in Europe, i suppose.😂"
"It is not just that more money can be made selling cars with combustion engines, auto manufacturers make the vast majority of their profits selling replacement parts and most of those replacement parts are parts that just don't wear out on electric cars. Like, no water pumps, no radiator hoses, no alternators, also brake pads wear much slower due to regenerative braking."
What about the pollution making the lithium batteries.
The country can't force ppl to get EVs
They tried EVs back in the 1920s and it didn't work.  Now we are in 2024 and EVs still aren't working.
Really enjoyed the video though. Good job!
"Point 3; the carbon footprint of an ev is about half that of an ICE vehicle
Wrong. The huge energy cost of production, of EVs, means that by the time the battery is done, the EV has only just repayed it's ""carbon debt"". Then its scrap, leaving a legacy carbon debt."
"Point 2: People largely ignore total cost of ownership. 
Wrong. The more elite an ICE vehicle is, the greater the investment potential. Also, even old ICE classic cars, which cost just a few thousand dollars in say the 70's, can cost a hundred thousand today.
Everyone knows that your investment in an EV is for a single life cycle. Its scrap, with virtually no resale value, in just 8 or so years."
"Point 1: batteries will become much smaller and much more energy dense.
Wrong. The development curve is an ""S curve"". The start and finish are the most expensive and lowest ""earned value"" sections, taking up about 10% each. So, based on that fundamental, Li-Ion batteries are alreadybat about 90% of their potential. High purity Alumina can improve this further, but not by more than about another 10%, at even higher cost."
Cmon bruh. Really not going to mention that most ICE vehicles get around 25mi per 33.7kWh where as EVs get about 134 miles?
Thank you Sheldon
"In sum, they are far from dead because short-term thinking prevails. ""Murica."
3:59 is black magick
"That but also replacement you will have to replace the batteries and they are less efficient the lower the charge , unlike gas where your car gets lighter the closer it it to empty"
"Hmmm, no mention that you probably charge your car from electricity generated by burning coal. Batteries materials mined by slave children in Congo. Oh, and those batteries are not effectively recyclable. Oh, and the rare but horrific fires."
"Cars in the UK are more fuel efficient than cars in the US (even for similar-sized vehicles, Ford Focus Zetec for example). Switch to diesel and make more efficient engines. It's the most practical step at this stage and will lead to more development down the road instead of investing so much in something that does not work at this point."
70% of the energy in gasoline is wasted as heat and friction. About 10% of the electricity an EV is wasted.
Why can`t both technologies be combined into a more beneficent way ?..the electric motor has amazing  torque and the combustion engine has the ability to generate electricity and torque without a heavy batteries systems..the magic here would be the modernization of the alternator charging system..yes I know hybrids do this -but not in a completely beneficial and efficient way- a complete unison drive-train system..we actually use this concept everyday in combustion engine vehicles- but just to keep the electrical system going during use.
Unfortunately cost of ownership wasn’t even mentioned
"This video is aging like fine wine.  EE, perhaps you should re-release it."
In the weight comparison the weight of a gas engine is substantially more then the weight of an electric motor
what did you do with all those cans?
"So, I wasn’t familiar with La Croix soda. I came across it at the supermarket today and bought some 😅. Great video BTW. Subscribed."
"Regarding EV maintenance, keep in mind that replacing the battery pack can be prohibitively expensive if not covered by warranties."
The word is pronounced “pomp-la-moose” fyi.
"4:16 Don't you also have to consider the fact that internal combustion engines are far less efficient than electric cars? Internal combustion engines are like 20-30% efficient, while electric cars are like 80% efficient. Most of the energy in gasoline cars is lost as heat."
"Something that I continually see as an example, but no one delves too deep into, is that so many EV owners admit they they have to have a second ICE car for road trips, etc. What I never see factored into the cost of owning an EV is the additional cost of the ICE car for back up. Some people will argure ""well....   I use the EV for around town and save the cost of the gas"". If I still have to have an ICE vehicle, and the only reason I have the EV is to save on gas for around town, I can argue that I can buy a LOT of gas for the cost of the EV. So, if a person still has to own an ICE because the EV won't do what THEY need to do then it's hardly cost effective to own both."
"I don't know, But what about (Hybrid Cars) They use a gasoline engine with an electrical motor."
"You don't get it, don't you?
It does not matter if we can replace the performance of gas, because we should had stopped using it yesterday🙄
The entire video follows the wrong premise, spreads the wrong idea and is responsible for trillions of dollar in damage due to freak weather. Shame on you!"
"They know future is electric. They know the world will end in 2018. They know women have penises. They just know, what to say."
"Mainly why the diesel engine will never go away. Impossible. For a single EV to exist. It takes thousands of diesel-powered equipment to make one single battery. To make every part of a EV. Again. We have thousands of diesel-powered equipment to get all the supplies from the ground, to the factory, to the dealership. Where I say earth doesn't have a IQ. It's called reverse engineering. Like EVs or not. If it wasn't for the common engine. An EV would never exist. Yet. It's entertaining to read the comments, etc. On what people think. Like. No more gas and diesel engines. Yes!!!! Well. That means no EVs at all. The battery materials come from Africa. Then. Has to go to China. Then. Wherever. Go take your EV and go do it then. I watch. Maybe. Yet. Thanks for the entertainment and proving Earth has no IQ."
I may not agree with everything you present but I really appreciate your approach and fairness presented.
"All the reasons stated here are the reason why US and EU car makers will be beaten by the Chinese.  China is going all-in on electric cars.  This video all made sense in 2018, and it’s what the US car manufacturers did. Now they are all failing in China, which is the largest car market in the world. China is starting to import electric cars to the West that are cheaper and better than their western competitors.  There is a paradigm shift that the western car manufacturers weren’t ready for, and still aren’t ready for.  It’s too late for them to catch up now.  Sorry but it’s true."
"Lfp batteries are even less energy dense, we've come a long way in 4 years... Lol"
You use only 1/3 of the energy content on gasoline... the rest is heat to the atmosphere
